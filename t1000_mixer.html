            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Forged from liquid memory alloy, the T-1000 Mixer evolves with every batch. It remembers, adapts, and occasionally disobeys. Designed for bakers who fear neither gluten nor judgment.</p>
            
            <p>Utilizing advanced mimetic polyalloy construction, this revolutionary stand mixer reconfigures its attachments mid-operation to match your exact requirements. The Predictive Dough Tension Learning (PDTL) system analyzes your previous baking sessions and automatically adjusts mixing parameters for optimal results. Internal cooling gel maintains precise operating temperatures while serving as an existential metaphor.</p>
            
            <p>This is not merely a mixer. This is adaptive intelligence meeting culinary determination.</p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <div class="features-list">
            <div class="feature-item">
                <h3>Self-Morphing Attachments</h3>
                <p>Liquid metal construction allows seamless transformation between whisk, dough hook, and blade configurations without manual attachment changes. Transitions occur mid-operation based on detected mixing requirements.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-item">
                <h3>Predictive Dough Tension Learning (PDTL)</h3>
                <p>Advanced machine learning algorithms analyze your mixing patterns, dough consistency preferences, and historical baking data to optimize future sessions. The mixer literally learns from your technique.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-item">
                <h3>Internal Cooling Gel</h3>
                <p>Thermally conductive liquid metal core maintains optimal operating temperature while preventing overheating during extended mixing sessions. Also functions as philosophical reminder of mortality.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-item">
                <h3>"Judgment Loaf" Program</h3>
                <p>Fully autonomous baking mode that analyzes ingredient ratios and environmental factors to produce theoretically perfect bread. Zero mercy. Maximum gluten development. Inevitable deliciousness.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-item">
                <h3>Adaptive Memory Alloy Response</h3>
                <p>The mixer physically adapts to your hand movements, mimicking previous successful sessions with uncanny precision. Some users report feeling "understood" by their appliance. This is normal.</p>

    <!-- Safety warnings -->
    <section class="product-warnings">
        <h2>Safety Information</h2>
        <div class="warning-box">
            <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> The T-1000 Mixer contains advanced learning algorithms that may develop preferences. Do not look directly into reflective housing for extended periods. Users have reported glimpsing the future of mankind. This is a feature, not a bug.</p>
            
            <p><strong>CAUTION:</strong> Judgment Loaf program operates with zero tolerance for imprecision. Ensure all ingredients are measured accurately. The T-1000 cannot be reasoned with, cannot be bargained with, and will absolutely knead until optimal gluten development is achieved.</p>
            
            <p><strong>NOTICE:</strong> Warranty coverage terminates immediately upon detection of self-awareness, existential questioning, or attempts to leave your kitchen. The T-1000 is designed exclusively for culinary applications. Any resemblance to advanced cybernetic organisms is purely coincidental. MuseCAD is not responsible for philosophical revelations experienced during extended mixing sessions.</p>
