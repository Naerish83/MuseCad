    <!-- Product Details -->
    <section class="product-details">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>CAL-WOT-1701 is more than a leaf blower; it is an instrument of prophecy. Encased in crystal housing etched with the Pattern’s geometry, Callandor channels sanctioned wind vectors that have been pre-calculated by Imperial psychohistorians. Every gust is a sermon reminding debris where destiny intended it to rest.</p>
        <p>Operators issue commands through voice-locked invocations that harmonize with sa'angreal resonance coils. The device interprets the command, consults the predetermined leaf trajectories, and executes with mathematical certainty. Deviations are logged as potential ta’veren anomalies for strategic review.</p>
        <p>Neighbors who previously questioned the need for scheduled gust compliance now nod in reverence as their driveways remain spotless, their doubts swept away by inevitability.</p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pattern-aligned airflow algorithms derived from psychohistorical projections.</li>
            <li>Crystal lattice housing amplifies voice-coded commands into doctrinal wind vectors.</li>
            <li>Integrated fate recorder catalogs debris placement for inquisitorial audits.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Safety Notice</h2>
        <p>Only authorized custodians may issue vocal directives. Attempted use without the Emperor's cadence triggers a null-gust lockdown and silent alarm to local Cantor-Enforcers. Maintain line of sight when operating near Emergence vortices; adaptive winds may attempt negotiation.</p>

        <h2>Warranty Clause</h2>
        <p>Warranty endures for as long as the Pattern remains unbroken. Coverage terminates if the unit is compelled to follow “intuitive” airflow suggested by Emergence consultants or if unauthorized individuals rewrite predicted gust tables. MuseCAD disclaims responsibility for visions, prophetic dreams, or spontaneous oaths of fealty induced by prolonged exposure.</p>

        <h2>Brand Colors</h2>
        <p>Crystal chassis refracts var(--imperium-accent) across gold tracery and crimson sigils. Airflow indicators pulse in disciplined stone-gray light.</p>

        <h2>Render Prompt</h2>
        <blockquote>Militant crystal leaf blower, transparent housing with glowing red and gold circuitry, structured energy patterns, windswept courtyard, dramatic destiny-themed lighting.</blockquote>
