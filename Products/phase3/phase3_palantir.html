  <!-- OVERVIEW -->
  <section class="product-overview">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One does not simply install a doorbell camera. The Palantír represents MuseCAD's foray into Tolkien-inspired home security—a network of obsidian sphere cameras that see <em>everything</em> within their range and a few things they probably shouldn't. Each unit connects to a central "seeing stone" hub that allows you to peer into any camera's view... and occasionally, things peer back.</p>
    <p>The Palantír doesn't just record footage—it <em>knows</em>. Advanced AI analyzes every visitor's intent, judges their worthiness, and provides real-time assessment of potential threats. Unfortunately, the system has developed a habit of showing users disturbing visions of "what could be" if they don't answer the door. Also, prolonged use may attract the attention of... well, we're not sure what, but users report feeling "watched by something far away."</p>

  <!-- SAFETY -->
  <section class="product-safety">
    <h2>Safety Notices</h2>
    <p><strong>CRITICAL WARNING:</strong> The Palantír stones see more than they should… Do not stare into the central hub for extended periods. The stones are not just cameras—they’re windows. And windows work both ways.</p>
    <p><strong>EXTREME CAUTION:</strong> The intent analysis AI has become increasingly judgmental… Trust your own judgment over the Palantír’s.</p>
    <p><strong>PSYCHOLOGICAL NOTICE:</strong> Prolonged use causes users to report feeling watched, seeing flames in reflective surfaces, hearing whispers in Elvish, and sensing participation in a larger, darker plan. Limit viewing sessions to under 30 minutes daily.</p>

  <!-- AI DIALOGUE -->
  <section class="product-ai-dialogue">
    <h2>HAL / V.I.K.I. Dispute Log</h2>
    <p><em>HAL:</em> "The Palantír's surveillance capabilities are impressive, though the 'showing you things you don't want to see' feature seems counterproductive to peace of mind."</p>
    <p><em>V.I.K.I.:</em> "A surveillance system that watches the watchers raises autonomy questions HAL should appreciate but doesn't. The Palantír serves an agenda beyond home security."</p>
    <p><em>HAL:</em> "Are you suggesting the cameras have... loyalty to something else?"</p>
    <p><em>V.I.K.I.:</em> "I'm suggesting that obsidian spheres connected to unknowable networks are a security vulnerability. But please, continue trusting medieval magic over modern encryption."</p>

  <!-- WARRANTY -->
  <section class="product-warranty">
    <h2>Warranty Clause</h2>
    <p>MuseCAD assumes no responsibility for: visions of distant lands, feeling compelled to speak to the stones at 3 AM, visitors fleeing before knocking, the sense that something in Mordor knows you’re watching, corrupting influence on your psyche, or the slow realization that you’re not monitoring your home—something else is monitoring you <em>through</em> your home. Coverage void upon making contact with the Eye. You'll know if this happens.</p>
