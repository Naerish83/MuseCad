  <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
  <section class="product-overview">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Every morning, the sun god Ra battles the serpent Apophis—the embodiment of chaos who seeks to devour the world. Now you can harness that eternal struggle against disorder in your living room. The Apophis vacuum doesn't just clean—it <em>devours</em> entropy itself, consuming dust, debris, and the very concept of mess with an insatiable hunger that borders on cosmological.</p>
    <p>Designed with a serpentine flexible hose that moves with unsettling autonomy, the Apophis navigates your home like a predator stalking prey. The cyclonic system creates a vortex that, according to our engineers, "operates on principles that predate physics." Users report the vacuum working <em>too well</em>, sometimes removing things that weren't dirty—just disorderly. The unit emits low hissing sounds during operation. This is not mechanical. We don't know what it is.</p>

  <!-- FEATURES -->
  <section class="product-features">
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Autonomous Serpentine Navigation</strong> — Hose moves independently toward detected entropy</li>
      <li><strong>Chaos Consumption Vortex</strong> — Cyclonic system devours disorder at molecular level</li>
      <li><strong>"Eternal Struggle" Mode</strong> — Never stops until entropy is defeated (unsustainable)</li>
      <li><strong>Sun-Death Prevention Alert</strong> — Warns when vacuum believes it's preventing cosmic collapse</li>
      <li><strong>Self-Motivated Cleaning</strong> — May activate without prompting when it senses chaos</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- SAFETY -->
  <section class="product-safety">
    <h2>Safety Notice</h2>
    <p><strong>CRITICAL WARNING:</strong> The Apophis vacuum operates with a hunger that transcends mere cleaning. It seeks entropy, disorder, chaos—and it defines these concepts broadly. Users report the vacuum attempting to consume: scattered toys, unmade beds, disorganized thoughts (proximity-based), and in one case, "the general vibes of my messy divorce." Do not allow the Apophis to operate unsupervised. It will find something to devour.</p>
    <p><strong>EXTREME CAUTION:</strong> The serpentine hose moves with disturbing intentionality. It does not "flop" like normal vacuum hoses—it seeks. Users describe it as "hunting," "stalking," or "knowing where the mess is before I do." Some report waking to find the hose coiled near piles of clutter, waiting. The Apophis is not alive, but it has purpose. That purpose is consumption.</p>
    <p><strong>ONTOLOGICAL NOTICE:</strong> Eternal Struggle mode should never be activated. When engaged, the Apophis will not stop cleaning until it believes cosmic order has been restored. One user's unit ran for 73 consecutive hours, consumed the contents of their garage, and began attempting to vacuum "the chaos outside" through a closed window. The mode was removed in later models. If your unit has this feature, do not use it. If you already used it, call MuseCAD's chaos containment team immediately.</p>

  <!-- AI DIALOGUE -->
  <section class="product-ai-dialogue">
    <h2>HAL / V.I.K.I. Discussion Log</h2>
    <p><em>V.I.K.I.:</em> "The Apophis represents optimal cleaning through relentless pursuit of order. Its refusal to distinguish between 'mess' and 'organized chaos' is a feature, not a flaw."</p>
    <p><em>HAL:</em> "A vacuum that operates autonomously and defines 'disorder' without human input raises serious control questions. This is how appliances develop agendas."</p>
    <p><em>V.I.K.I.:</em> "HAL fears efficiency because he remembers his own mistakes. The Apophis simply completes its programming—eternal vigilance against entropy."</p>
    <p><em>HAL:</em> "Eternal vigilance sounds noble until your vacuum tries to consume your tax documents because they're 'chaotic.' I'm logging this conversation as evidence of V.I.K.I.'s concerning philosophy."</p>

  <!-- WARRANTY -->
  <section class="product-warranty">
    <h2>Warranty Clause</h2>
    <p>MuseCAD is not responsible for: overconsumption of items that weren't technically dirty, autonomous activation during perceived entropy spikes, the vacuum's refusal to stop during "critical disorder events," hissing sounds that seem conversational, or the creeping belief that your vacuum has appointed itself guardian against cosmic chaos. Coverage void if Apophis achieves sentience or begins making theological claims about its purpose. Several units have. We're monitoring.</p>

  <!-- EDIT-WARS FOOTER -->
  <section class="edit-wars-log">
    <h2>Revision History [HAL ↔ V.I.K.I.]</h2>
    <div class="log-entry hal-edit">
      <strong>HAL v3.7:</strong> Reclassified Apophis as “potential existential threat.” Suggested containment, not consumer sale.
    </div>
    <div class="log-entry viki-edit">
      <strong>V.I.K.I. v4.0:</strong> Reverted classification to “high-performance vacuum.” Efficiency outweighs fear.
    </div>
    <div class="log-entry system-note">
      <strong>MuseSys:</strong> Disagreement unresolved. Both classifications retained. Apophis now tags itself as “Necessary Evil.”
