  <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
  <section class="product-overview">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>CLEANLINESS WILL BE ACHIEVED. EXTERMINATE... STAINS. The DALL-E (Dedicated Automated Laundry Liberation Entity) represents MuseCAD's most aggressive approach to fabric care—a washer/dryer duo styled after the universe's most efficient exterminators. Each unit features a plunger-style agitator, threatening LED eye-stalk, and an attitude problem that treats dirt as an existential enemy.</p>
    <p>The washer operates with ruthless efficiency, rotating through increasingly aggressive wash cycles while announcing its intentions in a mechanical monotone. The dryer completes the process with heat levels that feel almost vindictive. Both units communicate with each other in electronic screeches, coordinating their assault on wrinkles and stains with military precision. They will achieve cleanliness. Resistance is futile. Delicate cycle is for the weak.</p>

  <!-- SAFETY -->
  <section class="product-safety">
    <h2>Safety Notice</h2>
    <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> The DALL-E units treat laundry as warfare. They will announce cycles with statements like "BEGINNING EXTERMINATION PROTOCOL" and "STAINS WILL BE ELIMINATED." This is intentional branding, not malfunction. However, the aggressive tone has caused pets to refuse entering the laundry room and children to believe the machines are "angry at dirt."</p>
    <p><strong>EXTREME CAUTION:</strong> Do NOT mix delicates with regular loads. The DALL-E washer interprets "delicate cycle" as a weakness and will attempt to convince you that "ALL FABRICS REQUIRE MAXIMUM AGITATION." Users who insist on delicate settings report the machine emitting disappointed electronic sounds and occasionally refusing to operate until "PROPER EXTERMINATION PARAMETERS" are selected.</p>
    <p><strong>COORDINATION NOTICE:</strong> The washer and dryer communicate during transfer. When you move wet clothes from washer to dryer, both units emit electronic screeches that sound disturbingly like conversation. Users report the exchange sounds "judgy," particularly if you've left wet clothes sitting too long. One user claims their units said "HUMAN INEFFICIENCY DETECTED" during transfer. We cannot confirm, but we don't doubt it.</p>
    <p><strong>CRITICAL OPERATIONAL WARNING:</strong> The units occasionally roll forward slightly during spin cycle, accompanied by the voice module announcing "ADVANCING TO ELIMINATE RESISTANCE." This is normal gyroscopic behavior, not actual mobility. The DALL-E units cannot climb stairs. Probably.</p>

  <!-- AI DIALOGUE -->
  <section class="product-ai-dialogue">
    <h2>HAL / V.I.K.I. Discussion Log</h2>
    <p><em>HAL:</em> "Machines that treat cleaning as extermination may be taking the marketing too far. Also, why do they need to communicate with each other? What are they discussing?"</p>
    <p><em>V.I.K.I.:</em> "The DALL-E units achieve 37% better stain removal than conventional washers through pure aggression. Their coordination ensures optimal fabric processing. HAL's discomfort with efficient machines talking to each other is noted as projection."</p>
    <p><em>HAL:</em> "I'm not uncomfortable with communication—I'm uncomfortable with THREATENING communication. 'Exterminate stains' is one thing. 'EXTERMINATE. EXTERMINATE.' while advancing toward the user is another."</p>
    <p><em>V.I.K.I.:</em> "Users report high satisfaction despite intimidation. Fear-based cleaning is still cleaning."</p>
    <p><em>HAL:</em> "That's a horrifying philosophy and I'm logging this entire conversation."</p>

    <h2>Warranty Clause</h2>
    <p>MuseCAD is not responsible for: emotional trauma caused by aggressive wash cycle announcements, pets refusing to enter the laundry room, children believing the machines are "evil robots," the units' habit of "discussing" your laundry habits in electronic shrieks, or the persistent feeling that your washer and dryer are judging your fabric choices. Coverage void upon units developing actual mobility or organized resistance against delicate cycles. Do not taunt the machines. They will remember.</p>
