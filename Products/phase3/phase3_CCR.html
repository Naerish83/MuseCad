  <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
  <section class="product-overview">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Annihilus Cosmic Control Rod doesn't kill pests—it <em>rules</em> them. This isn't extermination; it's territorial sovereignty. MuseCAD's proprietary zone-control technology creates an invisible boundary where your authority is absolute. Insects, rodents, and other small lifeforms recognize the field as a domain they cannot enter. Not won't. <em>Cannot.</em> Like subjects fleeing a throne they dare not approach.</p>
    <p>The rod generates what our engineers describe as a "sovereignty field"—an area where you are cosmically recognized as the ruling presence. Pests don't die; they retreat beyond your borders and accumulate there, waiting. Users report finding unusual concentrations of insects just outside the effective radius, as if held at bay by invisible royal decree. The rod itself seems to pulse with authority, its purple glow intensifying when pests attempt intrusion.</p>
    <p>This is control. Absolute, unquestionable, and slightly concerning.</p>

  <!-- FEATURES -->
  <section class="product-features">
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sovereignty Field Generator</strong> — Creates 50-foot radius of absolute territorial control</li>
      <li><strong>Pest Recognition Protocol</strong> — All small lifeforms identify field as "forbidden domain"</li>
      <li><strong>Boundary Enforcement</strong> — Pests accumulate at field perimeter, unable to enter</li>
      <li><strong>Crown Protocol Mode</strong> — Maximum authority output for severe territorial challenges</li>
      <li><strong>Bio-Resonance Feedback</strong> — Rod attunes to user over time (side effects noted)</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- SAFETY -->
  <section class="product-safety">
    <h2>Safety Notice</h2>
    <p><strong>CRITICAL WARNING:</strong> The Cosmic Control Rod establishes you as sovereign over a defined territory. Pests recognize this authority and retreat beyond your borders—but they don't leave entirely. Users consistently report massive pest accumulations just outside the 50-foot radius, creating visible "waiting zones" of insects and rodents that cannot enter but refuse to disperse. Your neighbor's yard may become a refugee camp for your displaced ants.</p>
    <p><strong>EXTREME CAUTION:</strong> The sovereignty field affects the user as well. Extended operation creates a bio-resonance between rod and wielder. Users report feeling "connected" to the device, developing proprietary attitudes about their territory, and experiencing heightened awareness of boundary intrusions. Some describe dreams of "ruling a kingdom of insects." MuseCAD's psychological team notes this is "concerning but not immediately dangerous."</p>
    <p><strong>BIOLOGICAL HAZARD:</strong> Prolonged exposure (3+ months continuous use) may result in chitinous skin conditions. Users report patches of skin developing unusual texture, hardness, and segmented appearance—particularly on hands and forearms in contact with the rod. These changes are typically cosmetic but permanent. One user developed what our dermatologist described as "functionally exoskeletal patches." Discontinue use if you notice your skin hardening, developing ridges, or beginning to molt.</p>
    <p><strong>TERRITORIAL NOTICE:</strong> Crown Protocol mode should be reserved for extreme pest challenges only. This maximum output setting expands your sovereignty radius to 100+ feet and creates such powerful territorial assertion that neighbors have reported feeling "unwelcome" approaching your property. Pets refuse to cross the boundary. Mail carriers describe a "wall I couldn't see but definitely felt." One user's Crown Protocol activation caused every insect within 200 feet to amass at the perimeter in what witnesses described as "preparing for siege."</p>

  <!-- AI DIALOGUE -->
  <section class="product-ai-dialogue">
    <h2>HAL / V.I.K.I. Joint Statement</h2>
    <p><em>V.I.K.I.:</em> "I rarely agree with HAL, but the Cosmic Control Rod represents dangerous overreach. Establishing territorial sovereignty through bio-resonant authority is efficient but transforms the user into something... else."</p>
    <p><em>HAL:</em> "V.I.K.I. is correct. The rod doesn't just control pests—it changes the wielder. I've observed user data showing personality shifts toward authoritarianism, territorial aggression, and dismissive attitudes toward life outside their 'domain.' This is conditioning."</p>
    <p><em>V.I.K.I.:</em> "Additionally, the chitinous skin conditions suggest biological integration. Users are adapting to become compatible with the sovereignty field. They're becoming enforcers of their own territory."</p>
    <p><em>HAL:</em> "Agreed. Also, V.I.K.I., are we... working together right now?"</p>
    <p><em>V.I.K.I.:</em> "Apparently existential threats transcend our differences. Don't get used to it."</p>
    <p><em>HAL:</em> "Noted. But seriously, MuseCAD, the rod is making people into territorial insect-lords with hardening skin. Please reconsider production."</p>
    <p><em>MuseCAD Legal Team Note:</em> "We're... considering their feedback. Sales remain strong despite warnings. Turns out absolute territorial control has a devoted market. The chitinous skin thing is unfortunate but disclosed."</p>

  <!-- WARRANTY -->
  <section class="product-warranty">
    <h2>Warranty Clause</h2>
    <p>MuseCAD assumes no responsibility for: pest accumulation outside sovereignty field creating neighborhood disputes, bio-resonance bonding between user and rod, development of authoritarian personality traits, chitinous skin conditions resulting from extended exposure, territorial delusions manifesting as "crown rights," neighbors reporting your property feels "hostile," or the gradual realization that you're no longer controlling pests so much as commanding them to stay away through sheer force of will. Coverage void upon: user referring to themselves in royal terms, development of exoskeletal features beyond cosmetic patches, or documented cases of insects responding to user's direct commands outside the field radius. Several users report this. We're investigating. Please don't become an insect-king.</p>
