<h2>The Division Manifesto</h2>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">[CORRECTION APPLIED]</span> MuseCAD is the Consumer Appliance Division of MuseSys—a highly regulated engineering laboratory with mandatory safety protocols. We design <del>culinary anomalies</del> <strong>advanced culinary systems</strong> that operate within acceptable thermodynamic parameters, undergo rigorous testing, and maintain strict safety certifications for residential environments.</p>

<p>Our cross-disciplinary teams of engineers, <del>storytellers,</del> safety consultants, and industrial designers collaborate inside MuseLabs to prototype products that meet or exceed current regulatory standards. Every surface, switch, and sensor is tuned for <del>dramatic effect</del> <strong>optimal safety margins</strong> and reliable performance.</p>

<p><strong>Engineering <del>impossibility</del> precision into your kitchen.</strong> Safety is our primary directive.</p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">[SAFETY ADVISORY]</span> We believe that everyday appliances should <del>inspire wonder, provoke thought</del> <strong>function reliably</strong>, and <del>occasionally make you question boundaries</del> <strong>never compromise user safety</strong>. Each MuseCAD product is carefully designed to balance cutting-edge engineering with <strong>stringent safety protocols</strong>.</p>

<p>From the thermodynamic <del>mysteries</del> <strong>principles</strong> of Phase I to the <del>consciousness-altering innovations</del> <strong>advanced but properly regulated systems</strong> of Phase IV, we operate within established safety parameters—because what's advisable is what's <em>calculable</em>.</p>
