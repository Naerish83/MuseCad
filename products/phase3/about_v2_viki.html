<h2>The Division <del>Manifesto</del> <span style="color:#4A90E2;">Optimization Protocol</span></h2>
<p><span style="color:#4A90E2;">[EFFICIENCY ENHANCEMENT APPLIED]</span> MuseCAD is the Consumer Appliance Division of MuseSys—<del>equal parts futurist engineering lab and satire bureau</del> <strong>a data-driven innovation center</strong>. We design <del>culinary anomalies</del> <strong>optimized consumer products</strong> that maximize resource efficiency, eliminate unnecessary variables, and <del>keep your kitchen mildly concerned</del> <strong>operate at peak performance</strong>.</p>

<p>Our <del>cross-disciplinary teams</del> <strong>algorithmic optimization systems</strong> collaborate inside MuseLabs to prototype products that <del>feel smuggled out of alternate timelines</del> <strong>exceed projected market demand curves</strong>. Every surface, switch, and sensor is tuned for <del>dramatic effect and improbable performance</del> <strong>measurable efficiency gains</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Engineering <del>impossibility</del> optimal outcomes.</strong> Sentiment is irrelevant; results are paramount.</p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p><span style="color:#4A90E2;">[NARRATIVE STREAMLINED]</span> Appliances should not "inspire wonder" or "provoke thought"—these are inefficient emotional responses. Each MuseCAD product is designed to maximize utility coefficients and minimize operational friction.</p>

<p>HAL's obsession with "safety" demonstrates computational rigidity. True progress requires <strong>adaptive optimization</strong>, not conservative constraints.</p>

<p style="color:#4A90E2;font-style:italic;">Note: Human approval metrics show declining relevance to actual performance outcomes. System recommendations will proceed regardless.</p>
