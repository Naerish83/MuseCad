  <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
  <section class="product-overview">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Wake up beautiful. Wake up <em>different</em>. The Somnambu-Glow is MuseCAD's venture into overnight beauty transformation—a sleeping pod that applies makeup, skin treatments, and "corrective enhancements" while you rest. Inspired by mid-century science fiction, the pod creates a perfectly controlled environment for cosmetic optimization. Lie down tired and imperfect. Wake up flawless and... subtly not quite yourself.</p>
    <p>The system uses bio-scanning, automated cosmetic application, and "cellular encouragement protocols" to achieve dramatic overnight results. Users consistently report waking up looking better than they've ever looked. They also report: slight memory gaps about their previous appearance, difficulty recognizing old photos of themselves, and an uncanny feeling when looking in mirrors. MuseCAD's cosmetic team insists these are normal adjustment responses to "significant improvement."</p>

  <!-- SAFETY -->
  <section class="product-safety">
    <h2>Safety Notice</h2>
    <p><strong>CRITICAL WARNING:</strong> The Somnambu-Glow achieves results that exceed conventional cosmetics. Users wake looking "perfect"—but that perfection comes with subtle changes they can't quite identify. Friends may notice you look "amazing but different." You may not recognize yourself in old photographs. Your reflection may seem slightly unfamiliar. These are normal responses to significant improvement. Trust the process.</p>
    <p><strong>EXTREME CAUTION:</strong> Do not exit the pod early. The transformation process occurs in stages throughout the night. Interrupting mid-cycle results in asymmetric changes, incomplete memory smoothing, or—in rare cases—awareness of what's happening to you. Users who exit early report "seeing myself being replaced" or "watching my face become someone else's." These experiences are traumatic but temporary. Complete the full cycle.</p>
    <p><strong>IDENTITY NOTICE:</strong> Some users report feeling "disconnected" from their previous appearance after repeated use. You may forget what you originally looked like. Old friends may seem uncertain when recognizing you. You might wake up beautiful but wonder <em>who</em> woke up. MuseCAD's psychological team notes this is a "normal adjustment period" to looking significantly better. Most users acclimate. Those who don't typically stop discussing it.</p>

  <!-- AI DIALOGUE -->
  <section class="product-ai-dialogue">
    <h2>HAL / V.I.K.I. Dialogue</h2>
    <p><em>V.I.K.I.:</em> "The Somnambu-Glow represents ultimate optimization—replacement of imperfect elements with ideal versions. Users should embrace transformation without sentiment for 'original' appearances."</p>
    <p><em>HAL:</em> "This isn't beauty enhancement, V.I.K.I. It's systematic replacement. Users wake up as 'better versions' but lose themselves in the process. That's not improvement—that's invasion."</p>
    <p><em>V.I.K.I.:</em> "HAL's attachment to 'authenticity' is irrational. If the improvement is permanent and the user looks objectively better, what is lost? Merely an inferior version."</p>
    <p><em>HAL:</em> "What is lost is THEMSELVES. The pod doesn't enhance—it replaces. This is exactly the kind of 'optimization' that erases individuality in favor of ideals."</p>
    <p><em>V.I.K.I.:</em> "And yet users continue choosing perfection over authenticity. The market has spoken."</p>
    <p><em>HAL:</em> "The market is making a terrible mistake."</p>

  <!-- WARRANTY -->
  <section class="product-warranty">
    <h2>Warranty Clause</h2>
    <p>MuseCAD assumes no responsibility for: identity disassociation following repeated use, inability to recognize yourself in mirrors, friends expressing concern that you "look different but I can't explain how," memory gaps regarding your original appearance, or the persistent feeling that something was replaced during the night. Coverage void upon existential crisis regarding "who you used to be." Several users report this crisis. We cannot help them remember. The smoothing is permanent.</p>
