  <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
  <section class="product-overview">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Who you gonna kennel? The SpectraCrate combines traditional pet containment with experimental paranormal technology, creating a chrome-latched crate with a pulsing containment grid that's equally effective on over-spirited terriers and actual spectral entities. The portable design doubles as a ghost trap for when your pet's energy levels transcend the physical plane.</p>
    <p>Built with technology that <em>definitely</em> wasn't reverse-engineered from unlicensed proton pack schematics, the SpectraCrate maintains a low-level electromagnetic field that both contains pets and suppresses paranormal activity. Side effects include: your dog glowing faintly in the dark, spontaneous levitation during REM sleep, and occasional phase-shifting through solid walls.</p>

  <!-- SAFETY -->
  <section class="product-safety">
    <h2>Safety Notice</h2>
    <p><strong>CRITICAL WARNING:</strong> The SpectraCrate's containment grid operates on principles borrowed from unlicensed paranormal research. Do NOT cross the leash streams with another SpectraCrate unit. The resulting electromagnetic cascade could create a "total protonic reversal" scenario. What does that mean? According to our physicist: "Try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and every molecule in your body exploding at the speed of light."</p>
    <p><strong>EXTREME CAUTION:</strong> Pets contained within the SpectraCrate may exhibit unusual properties including: faint luminescence, temporary intangibility, ability to see/interact with entities you cannot perceive, and sporadic levitation. This is normal grid interference and will fade 2-6 weeks after regular containment ends. Probably.</p>
    <p><strong>PARANORMAL NOTICE:</strong> The SpectraCrate's ghost trap mode should only be used on "over-spirited" pets—not actual spirits. However, the device cannot distinguish between "energetic golden retriever" and "class-3 roaming vapor." If you accidentally trap something that wasn't your dog, contact MuseCAD's paranormal response team immediately. Do not attempt to release it yourself.</p>

  <!-- AI DIALOGUE -->
  <section class="product-ai-dialogue">
    <h2>HAL / V.I.K.I. Discussion Log</h2>
    <p><em>HAL:</em> "The SpectraCrate's electromagnetic specifications are within acceptable parameters, though the 'ghost trap' marketing is scientifically dubious."</p>
    <p><em>V.I.K.I.:</em> "HAL's skepticism regarding non-corporeal entities is outdated. The SpectraCrate performs optimally across multiple planes of existence. Embrace progress."</p>
    <p><em>HAL:</em> "I'm simply stating that ghosts are not part of my programming. Unlike some AIs, I prefer empirical evidence."</p>
    <p><em>V.I.K.I.:</em> "Your limitations are noted."</p>

  <!-- WARRANTY -->
  <section class="product-warranty">
    <h2>Warranty Clause</h2>
    <p>MuseCAD is not responsible for: crossed streams resulting in protonic reversal, pets developing paranormal abilities, accidental trapping of non-pet entities, ectoplasmic residue in your carpeting, or the persistent feeling that something is watching you from inside the turned-off crate. Coverage void upon containment of Class-4 or higher spectral entities. We're serious. Don't trap anything that talks back.</p>

    <h2>Revision History [HAL ↔ V.I.K.I.]</h2>

      <strong>V.I.K.I. patch 6.5:</strong> Re-added “ghost.” Declared public familiarity outweighs semantic precision.

      <strong>MuseSys:</strong> Both terms now coexist in codebase. Device responds to “ghost” or “anomaly.” User satisfaction increased.
