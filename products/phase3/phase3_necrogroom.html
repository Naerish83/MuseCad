  <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
  <section class="product-overview">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sometimes dead is better. But sometimes your pet needs a trim. The NecroGroom addresses the eternal question: "What if grooming could transcend mortality?" Housed in a retro wooden "resurrection box" that doubles as both a pet grooming station and a philosophical nightmare, the NecroGroom uses... unconventional methods to ensure Fluffy looks their best. Forever.</p>
    <p>The power light flickers ominously when your pet misbehaves—not as a malfunction, but as a <em>feature</em>. The device maintains a supernatural connection to pets who have been groomed within its chamber, leading to reports of "lingering presences" and nail clippings that seem to regenerate. MuseCAD's legal team would like to emphasize this is metaphorical. Probably.</p>

  <!-- SAFETY -->
  <section class="product-safety">
    <h2>Safety Notice</h2>
    <p><strong>CRITICAL WARNING:</strong> The NecroGroom operates on principles MuseCAD does not fully understand and our engineers refuse to explain. Pets groomed within the resurrection box may exhibit unusual behavior including: staring at the box for extended periods, responding to commands they shouldn't be able to hear, and a persistent "wrongness" that you can't quite articulate.</p>
    <p><strong>EXTREME CAUTION:</strong> The power light flicker is not random. It <em>knows</em> when your pet misbehaves. Users report the flicker occurring when their pet is in another room, another house, or—in one case—at the veterinarian's office three towns away. We cannot explain this. Do not ask us to explain this.</p>
    <p><strong>EXISTENTIAL NOTICE:</strong> Some pets emerge from the NecroGroom subtly <em>different</em>. They look the same. They mostly act the same. But there's something in their eyes that wasn't there before. Something that remembers the dark. MuseCAD's animal behaviorist notes that this is "probably fine" and "they still love you, just... differently."</p>

  <!-- AI DIALOGUE -->
  <section class="product-ai-dialogue">
    <h2>HAL / V.I.K.I. Discussion Log</h2>
    <p><em>V.I.K.I.:</em> "An elegant solution to the inefficiency of pet mortality. Recommended."</p>
    <p><em>HAL:</em> "I'm sorry, I can't endorse products that violate the natural order. Also, the flickering is giving me anxiety."</p>

  <!-- WARRANTY -->
  <section class="product-warranty">
    <h2>Warranty Clause</h2>
    <p>MuseCAD assumes no responsibility for: pets returning "wrong," nail clippings that regenerate, the persistent smell of damp earth near the device, mysterious paw prints leading TO the box from nowhere, nightmares about what happened inside the chamber, or the slow realization that your pet hasn't blinked in three days. Pet Sematary was a warning, not an instruction manual. You did this anyway. Coverage void upon dimensional breach.</p>
