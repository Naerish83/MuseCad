<h2>The Division Manifesto</h2>
<p>MuseCAD is the Consumer Appliance Division of MuseSys—equal parts futurist engineering lab and satire bureau. We design culinary anomalies that bend thermodynamics, stretch credulity, and keep your kitchen mildly concerned for its own safety.</p>

<p>Our cross-disciplinary teams of engineers, storytellers, and industrial designers collaborate inside MuseLabs to prototype products that feel smuggled out of alternate timelines. Every surface, switch, and sensor is tuned for dramatic effect and improbable performance.</p>

<p><strong>Engineering impossibility into your kitchen.</strong> That's the law we live by.</p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>We believe that everyday appliances should inspire wonder, provoke thought, and occasionally make you question the boundaries between fiction and functionality. Each MuseCAD product is carefully designed to balance cutting-edge engineering with narrative depth.</p>

<p>From the thermodynamic mysteries of Phase I to the consciousness-altering innovations of Phase IV, we push the envelope of what's possible—and what's advisable.</p>
